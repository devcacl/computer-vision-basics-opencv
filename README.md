# 🖼️ Image Processing and Face Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates basic computer vision techniques using **OpenCV** and **Python**, including:

- Image loading and inspection
- Grayscale conversion
- Edge detection using Canny
- Contour detection and analysis
- Detection of the largest contour
- Face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers

---

🧠 Techniques Used

🔹 Grayscale Conversion
Transforms the original image to grayscale to simplify processing.

🔹 Edge Detection (Canny)
Detects edges by identifying strong intensity gradients.

🔹 Contour Detection
Extracts external contours and highlights the largest contour found.

🔹 Face Detection
Uses OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect frontal faces.

📊 Output Information
The script prints useful information such as:

Image dimensions

Number of channels

Data type

Number of contours detected

Number of faces detected
